<li><p><b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762120301612">Accelerating CNN inference on ASICs: A Survey</a></b><br />
As you might have noticed, the field of deep learning is growing very rapidly and these networks are getting computationally intensive with each passing second !! With the end of Dennard scaling and Moore's law, not much can be done in the processor space. Thus, custom hardware architectures are emerging to the rescue. We have written a survey paper on accelerating the inference phase of the convolutional neural networks on the custom hardware. The survey is quite exhaustive and covers all the kinds of optimizations to accelerate these networks. This work has been accepted in Journal of Systems Architecture (JSA).</p>

<li><p><b><a href="files/papers/vissched.pdf">VisSched: An Auction based Scheduler for Vision Workloads on Heterogeneous Processors</a></b><br />
In this work, we start by characterizing the vision workloads and identifying their unique phase behavior. Subsequently, we develop an auction-theoretic scheduling scheme for such workloads on a multicore architecture. The scheme exploits the phase behavior of the vision workloads to simplify the scheduling decisions. This research work is comprehensive in the sense that we first characterize the computer vision applications on server-class processors, develop an auction-theoretic scheduling mechanism that is both starvation-free, and provides theoretical optimality guarantees for the corresponding schedules. This work was presented as a poster at DAC 2020,
as a full paper at ESWEEK CASES 2020, and will be published in IEEE TCAD.</p>

<li><p><b><a href="files/papers/diksha_ispass.pdf">Performance Prediction for Multi-Application Concurrency on GPUs</a></b><br />
To support the choice of server-class processors (in the previous work) and not any other platform such as GPUs, and FPGAs, we developed a decision tree based performance predictor for multi-application concurrency on GPUs. We clearly establish that GPUs are not the right choice when it comes to scheduling multiple applications concurrently. The predictor is able to provide an estimate of how the performance falls with the increasing number of applications. It relies on the CPU execution statistics and the fairness of schedule of the bag-of-task on multicores. This work has been accepted in IEEE ISPASS 2020.</p>

<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="files/projects/multimedia_array_onFPGA.pdf">Super Resolution on Reconfigurable Arrays</a> <br />
In this work, we implemented a convolutional neural network on a Virtex-6 FPGA to convert an SD video to an HD video in real time. The optimizations included computation time reduction by exploiting inherent parallelism, efficient matrix multiplication by using Toeplitz representation and memory footprint reduction by using a
rotating buffer instead of a full-size input buffer. We designed a self-defined protocol that exploited the OCP protocol to fetch image data in parallel from four DDR3 banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="files/projects/FPGA_Cluster.pdf">FPGA Cluster based parallel architecture for Cryptanalysis</a> <br /> 
In this work, we developed a high-speed communication network, consisting of four Virtex-6 FPGAs that communicated via the MGT protocol. In addition, we developed python and C wrappers for the PCIe bus drivers to implement DMA from Linux Kernel memory to FPGA BRAM space. This work was presented at National Workshop on Cryptology 2014.</p>

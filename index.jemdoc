=== Ph.D. Student, [http://www.iitd.ac.in/ IIT Delhi] \n
I am a Ph.D. student in [http://www.sit.iitd.ac.in/ SIT department] at IIT Delhi. I am working on novel architectures for vision and image processing 
under the guidance of [http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/ Prof. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi] and [http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~anshul/ Prof. Anshul Kumar]. 
Before joining Ph.D., I worked as a Project Associate with [http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~kolin/Kolins_Web_Home/My_Home.html Prof. Kolin Paul] 
and [http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~anshul/ Prof. Anshul Kumar] at IIT Delhi. I completed my Bachelors from [http://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/ IIIT Jabalpur] in 2015, 
with a majors in [http://ece.iiitdmj.ac.in/index.html Electronics and Communication Engineering]. I did my Bachelors thesis at [http://www.barc.gov.in/ BARC Mumbai], 
where I was advised by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheietk/ Mr. Abhishek Bajpai] and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/saket-saurav-18183719/ Mr. Saket Saurav].

Tejas Power Pack is a power model add-on for the [http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/papers/patmospaper.pdf Tejas] architectural simulator. 
This software takes a Tejas XML configuration file, and generates an XML file that contains the energy per access information
for all the structures in a processor. The tool is bundled with McPAT-v1.0 and Orion-v2.0 for simulating power and energy of CPU cores and NoC respectively.
